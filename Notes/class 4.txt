Express advance

Middleware: comes between route and final handler function (to vaildate etc)

app.get(("/path"), cb1(req,res){
next() //express feature
}, cb2, next)
---------------------------------
app.use() -> is called automatically for all the requests after it.

app.use(express.json()) to read the post body, because we don't know what body, it could be json, text etc.


Global catches: error handling middleware
app.use((err,req,res,next)=>{res.json({msg:"server down"})} it will catch it all the global errors
---------------------------------------
input validation
